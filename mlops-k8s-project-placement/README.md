# ML project/ ML model & build your own Docker Images
You can build your own Docker Images using Dockerfile that I have provided in this directory. Use the following comment to create your Docker Image. Before that make sure your docker daemon is running.

$ docker build -t <imageName>:<tagName> <Location of Dockerfile>
$ docker build -t placemnet-rank-app:v1 .
